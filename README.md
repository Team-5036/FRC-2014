This project contains the code we used in the 2013-2014 FRC season. This was our rookie year and we had many bumps and 
bruises esspeically in coding but weperceivered though. We ended up getting rookie All-Star Award from the the GTRE Regonal 
in Canada, our first regonal and were awarded with the ability to go to the Championships in St, Louis. All in all 2013-2014 
has been a real interesstig year and we are lookinh forwad to the future.

Our robot was designed to be defensive. It consisted of 1 large pistion that extraxted to block high goals. With the release 
of Chessy Vision, we were able to manipulate their code for our purposes allowing us to blocks goals in autonomous using 
operator input from the webcam. We also had a gate system that allowed us to catch and pass the ball effectivly.

Here is the code for those that are interested. It is coded using the iterative template.
